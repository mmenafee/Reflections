When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You might want to use a remote repository to have your files in another place just incase something goes wrong.
  GitHub is also a good place to get feedback on your project and have others build on your work. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because certain aspects that you changed in the remote respository you might not want in the local repository. It is always 
  better for it to be the judgment call of the human because it is their work. 
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are clones that are made only in GitHub. Nothing can be forked in the local repository. Cloning suggests either
  moving a file from GitHub to the local repository or cloning between local repositories. Branches help structure where commits   are;they are labels. You make a new branch when you want to add an experimental feature or create a different version of a 
  program, like an easy or hard mode.
